# GUI Based ID3 MP3 Tag Editor
### Allows you to write to entire files worth of mp3 files quickly and painlessly

###

This is a simple single file executable project that allows you to load a folder and then proceed to
list all the compatible files in a list that you can either pick which one to set the ID3 Data too or
use the Previous and Next Buttons to just go through the list one by one.


I Designed this as a work around for another project of mine. [Youtube Downloader](https://github.com/TheUncannyScrub/Youtube-video-downloader).
The youtube downlodaer could download entire playlists at once but wouldnt allow for meta data (id3 Tags) to be set. This software was that solution.
